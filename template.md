# Title
## Overview
<strong>Motivation:</strong> This project was 

<strong>Tech Stack:</strong> C++

For the final project, I implemented a simplified version of Doodle Jump on an <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/aup-boards/realdigital-urbana-board.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RealDigital Urbana Board</a>. Using a Spartan-7 FPGA with a MicroBlaze processor, I developed a real-time gaming environment that integrates gameplay mechanics, graphics, and keyboard controls. The game features character movement, random platform generation, collision detection, scoring, and an animated character, all rendered on a 640 by 480 screen. To achieve this, I implemented SPI communication for USB keyboard inputs and VGA-to-HDMI conversion. I designed custom modules for the gameplay features, showcasing the FPGA's capabilities through an interactive game.

### Notes
- Even though this was a partner class, my partner did not contribute to anything in this class from about Week 4 to the end. He didn't download the given files from the 5th lab on, and did not make a single contribution to this final project.
- This final project was built as an extension of the 6th lab in this course, so I have attached the lab report for both Lab 6 and the Final Project. To see all the design decisions I made, look through these reports.

# Portfolio Website v1
## Overview
<strong>Motivation:</strong> This project was essentially used as a way to display my skills and dip my toes in the world of frontend. I don't particularly aspire to be a front end developer, but I felt I should try it once.

<strong>Tech Stack:</strong> JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages

For this project, I took inspiration from ajlkn's HTML5 UP sites. The site was built using raw JavaScript and HTML, and was hosted on GitHub Pages because it was an easy solution. The site has a similar features, but notably has a skills section and a slideshow of the projects preview images that I chose to not implement on this site. Ultimately, I decided to build a new one from scratch because this one was a little too basic, and took a good amount of work to add or change pages. However, my old site is still live and you can visit it via the link below.
